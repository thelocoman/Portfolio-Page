Welcome to my portfolio page. Created to showcase my best work in software development. 

This project has 2 files in it:
    1. Personal_Page_1.html
    2. Personal_Page_2.html
The only reason for it is that there are parts from each file that are needed for the final page.

To run this program all you need to do is save the file on the Desktop and click on it, it will
automatically open. Even though this is a way to open the file and see the final way that it will
be presented. The project is meant to be deployed on AWS.

These two files were created and modified with Gemini and Chat-GPT, also by me manually.
